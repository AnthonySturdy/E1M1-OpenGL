# E1M1 Rendered in OpenGL.
This project is an E1M1 (from the original 1993 Doom) 3D model rendered in OpenGL using FreeGLUT.

It is my university coursework submission for my Fundamentals of Game and Graphical Systems Development module, semester 2. It's also the first 3D rendering software I've developed.

## Features
 - OBJ loading
 - BMP loading
 - Texturing
 - Simple lighting
 - Player controller
 - Navigation mesh collision
 - Radius (sphere) collision
 - UI text

## What I learned
This project was an introduction for me on 3D rendering. It has taught me the basics of rendering using OpenGL, I hope to use what this project has taught me to expand upon in future projects to make more advanced software.

This project also gave me more experience using C++ and using good programming practices.
